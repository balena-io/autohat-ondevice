        Starting alpine:3.19 with py3-pip v23.3.1-r0, py3-pip installations
        using

        apk will cause the error `error: externally-managed-environment` when
        pip

        attempts to upgrade the pip installation.  We now use a virtual env for

        the test app to avoid this issue.
